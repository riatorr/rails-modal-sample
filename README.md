# Example.com Full-Stack exercise

This repo contains a straightforward sample problem to solve: enhancing a plain-HTML signup page with an interactive signup modal. If time allows, ensure reasonable handling of success *and* failure to create the account (e.g., username is already taken).

## Instructions

* Fork this repository and submit a pull request that implements this change. Vue 2.6 is provided in the application, and is the framework we use in production, but is not required for this exercise.
**OR**
Create your own rails project with a front end framework of your choice.  Ensure that we can see your workflow through pull requests, implementation notes, test strategies, etc.

* Provide an explanation of steps you took, and any alternatie implementations you considered
* As this is a full stack project, some basic responsive styling should be included, however pixel perfection is not required, and an MVP is strongly encouraged.
* This is intended to take an hour or so of your time.
* If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. We don't want you struggling unnecessarily!

## Setup

This exercise is set up to use the following:

* Ruby 2.7
* NodeJS 12
* Vue 2.6
* Redis


## Goals

Basic competence is assumed, so the goals of this exercise are:

* Demonstrate how you break down a problem into achievable units of work.
* Demonstrate how you communicate your work.
* Demonstrate collaboration as we provide feedback on the pull request.
